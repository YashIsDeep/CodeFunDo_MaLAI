Prediction of impact
     
-Track realtime and previously available data to predict the chances of a certain disaster at a certain place
-Label all such surveyed places with their respective probabilities of impact from the disaster
-Group surveyed places into 3 categories: High risk,Mild risk and Safe zones
-Suggest the latter  one as "a suggested place for you to move to" to the former two
 
Storing user information for location tracking and notifying relatives

-Store contact info of three closely related people so as to notify them about the whereabouts of the user
-Store last known set of coordinates of the user and keep refreshing it in regular intervals.
-Collaborate with goods and service providers in high risk areas and calculate the amount of goods they can store based on the number of people in their areas.
-Live count of number of people presently located in this area.

Disaster specific guidelines and helpful tips
-Based on where the user is and what disaster is happening in that area suggest the user with associated risks of the disaster and things like which infections/illnesses to look out for
-Based on the which disaster could probably be happening in that area list Helpline numbers of nearest centers which could treat them as soon as possible
